Ones that don\u2019t are probably real but ones that have it you should be extra careful with but could be real. \n\n\n2. The spacing of the \u201cbe a visionary\u201d text at the bottom is way to tight / not enough spacing between the words.\n\n3. Colors of in particular the inner shirt look way too bright / not dark enough. Especially for the Black/Light Grey colorway this very easy too spot. Even though the colourway is called light grey is should actually be darker than you expect. \n\nHope this helps! Also just ask the seller for a purchase receipt / order confirmation."

Lighter colours might be worse but my black vital shorts aren\u2019t see through.\nOpt for thicker lines like adapt- so fleck and animal. Lift seamless is decent but not entirely opaque because of the thinner glute material"
