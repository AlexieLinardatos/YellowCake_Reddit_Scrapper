The new blue colorway short sleeve size S, green colorway short sleeve size S, grey colorway long sleeve size S, OG blue and black short sleeve size XS. Not going to sell them at insane scalping prices. All are 100% authentic.\nEDIT: willing to trade for YLA stuff like Superman. Just DM me. If trading, I will be picky."
