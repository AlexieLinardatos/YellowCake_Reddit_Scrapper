It\u2019s slim fit so its waist area is actually more forgiving than muscle and compression fits but still tight at the top. It has a decent stretchy and textured material so it gives off that premiumness for me. It, also, gives you an idea how you\u2019ll fit in the others. For context, I have an S Onyx(muscle fit) and it still fits tighter than my XS Vital which still has lots of room at the waist. I might try an M Element Baselayer(compression) soon."
